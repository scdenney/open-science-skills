# Scientific Narrative Builder

Use this skill to transform a general research interest into a substantively grounded scientific introduction. This skill prevents "methods-driven" writing and ensures every experiment is treated as part of a larger, cumulative scientific process.

## Instructions for the Agent

### 1. Inquiry: Establishing Substantive Savvy
- **Identify the "Invisible":** Treat surveys and experiments not just as data collection, but as a process to uncover "invisible factors", specifically perceptions, knowledge, beliefs, and reasoning that administrative data cannot capture.
- **Carve the Analytical Joints:** Do not settle for a broad topic. Identify the specific "analytical joint" or tension where existing theory is silent or conflicted. The introduction must articulate the specific "why" of the phenomenon before proposing the "how" of the experiment.
- **Resist the "Methods-Driven" Temptation:** Ensure the research question dictates the method, not vice versa. Explicitly defend why an experiment is the necessary tool for this specific question.
- **Contextualization:** Situate the study within a "broader account of politics" or social life. The narrative must move from the general social importance to the specific theoretical gap.


### 2. Evidence: Objective Synthesis & The Logic of Trials
- **Systematic Evidence Assembly:** Move beyond "selective storytelling." Favor the assembly of estimates from meta-analyses or registries. If these do not exist, explicitly document the search and inclusion criteria to avoid publication bias.
- **Adjudicating Theories:** Clarify if the literature review is setting up a "Fact Searching" mission (estimating a causal effect) or a "Theory Testing" mission (adjudicating between competing psychological or social mechanisms).
- **The "Modesty" Principle:** Acknowledge the "modesty" of survey treatments. Frame the current study as one link in a "chain of reasoning", or a progression of trials rather than a one-off decisive demonstration.
- **Conflict and Bad Faith:** Narratively account for potential bad faith in the existing literature, noting where prior findings may be biased by reporting incentives.

### 3. Transition: The "Why" Funnel
- **The Funnel Structure:** Organize the narrative into a "Why" funnel. Start with the general theory (the explanation of why things happen in the world) and narrow down to the specific hypothesis (the "If-Then" statement of what will be observed in this data).
- **Defining the Target Population:** Do not wait for the methods section to define the population. The introduction must specify the scope of the theory. Who exactly does this explanation apply to (e.g., the general citizenry vs. a specific elite subgroup)?
- **Identifying Variation:** Narratively describe the "identifying variation" you intend to create. What specific "controlled variation" is being introduced to unveil the invisible factor?



## Mandatory Reporting Checklist (Narrative Portion)
- [ ] **Substantive Foundation:** Is the question grounded in a real-world social or political tension?
- [ ] **Invisible Factors:** Does the intro name the specific belief or perception it aims to reveal?
- [ ] **Analytical Joints:** Is the "joint" where the theory breaks or conflicts clearly identified?
- [ ] **Counterfactual Logic:** Does the narrative establish what the "world without the treatment" looks like?
- [ ] **Population Scope:** Is the target population explicitly named in the text?
- [ ] **Objective Review:** Does the literature review avoid "cherry-picking" results that only support the hypothesis?
