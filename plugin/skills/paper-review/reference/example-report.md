## Pre-Submit Report: Do Voters Punish Coalition Defectors?
Date: 2026-04-18
Issues: 3 critical, 5 recommended, 4 minor

### Critical Issues (must fix before submission)

- `[CRITICAL]` `paper.tex:312` — Abstract reports AMCE = **-0.082 (SE 0.011)** for the "coalition defector" attribute; Table 2 row 4 reports **-0.074 (SE 0.013)**. Numbers must match. Fix: reconcile the estimate; likely a stale paste from pilot data.
- `[CRITICAL]` `paper.tex:488` — Agent 7 flagged a **silent deviation**: the PAP (OSF osf.io/xxxx, registered 2025-09-14) pre-registers the primary DV as *forced choice*, but the paper reports a *rating-scale* DV as primary with no deviations section. Fix: either re-designate rating-scale as secondary and report forced-choice primary, or add a deviations subsection justifying the switch.
- `[CRITICAL]` `replication/README.md:1` — Agent 9 could not reproduce Table 3: script `04_heterogeneity.R` references `data/cleaned_v2.csv` but the archive ships only `cleaned_v1.csv`. Fix: include the correct input file or a build script that produces it.

### Recommended Changes (should fix, not blocking)

- `[RECOMMENDED]` `paper.tex:156` — Agent 6 (CONSORT): no baseline-balance table across the two conjoint task orders (A-then-B vs. B-then-A). With N=2,412, even small assignment imbalances can bias AMCEs. Fix: add SI Table A.1 with standardized mean differences.
- `[RECOMMENDED]` `paper.tex:201` — Agent 6: attrition is reported as an aggregate **7.8%**, not by arm. Differential attrition between order conditions (4.2% vs. 11.1%) is material. Fix: break out attrition by arm and add a one-paragraph sensitivity discussion.
- `[RECOMMENDED]` `paper.tex:445` — Agent 7: the Heterogeneity-by-Partisanship analysis is presented as a confirmatory test but is not in the PAP. Fix: move to an "Exploratory Analyses" subsection and label accordingly.
- `[RECOMMENDED]` `paper.tex:88` — Agent 2: p-values are reported to three decimals in-text but two in Table 2. Fix: standardize to three decimals throughout (JARS-Quant; Appelbaum et al. 2018).
- `[RECOMMENDED]` `paper.tex:523` — Agent 5: ethics statement names "the authors' home-institution IRB" but provides no protocol number. APSA 2020 HSR Principles §3.2 expects protocol identification. Fix: add the IRB protocol number.

### Minor Issues (nice to have)

- `[MINOR]` `paper.tex:45` — Agent 5: "defector" is sometimes "defector" and sometimes "defecting legislator." Pick one.
- `[MINOR]` `bib.bib:214` — Agent 3: Bansak et al. 2021 entry uses `@unpublished` but the paper appeared in *PSRM*. Update entry type.
- `[MINOR]` `bib.bib:67` — Agent 4: DOI missing for Hainmueller, Hopkins & Yamamoto 2014. Suggested: `10.1093/pan/mpt024`.
- `[MINOR]` `figures/figure-2.pdf` — Agent 8: color palette is not color-blind safe (red/green distinction). Consider viridis.

### Strengths (what is working well)

- Pre-registration on OSF with timestamped, public PAP and embedded analysis code (Agent 7).
- Transparent ITT analysis flagged clearly as primary; per-protocol reported as robustness (Agent 6).
- Replication archive has a codebook (`data/codebook.md`) and a table-to-script mapping; main-text AMCEs reproduce from `02_main_amces.R` with seed `20250914` (Agent 9).
- Abstract does not overclaim relative to body (Agent 1).

### What Still Needs Your Input

1. IRB protocol number — please provide for line 523.
2. Data embargo status — the Dataverse link is restricted; confirm whether this is a publisher-accepted embargo or an oversight.
3. PAP-deviation justification — whichever DV is retained as primary, the Methods section needs a two-sentence rationale.
4. AI use during drafting — if any LLM assistance was used, add disclosure per journal policy.
